## Getting Started

### User documentation

If you ever need help on which arguments the driver requires, simply use the ```--help``` flag on the driver.

```console
$ ./finn --help
  -h [ --help ]                  Display help
  -m [ --mode ] arg (=test)      Mode of execution (file or test)
  -c [ --configpath ] arg        Path to the config.json file emitted by the 
                                 FINN compiler
  -i [ --input ] arg             Path to the input file. Only required if mode 
                                 is set to "file"
  -b [ --buffersize ] arg (=100) How large (in samples) the host buffer is 
                                 supposed to be
```

If the execution of the C++ driver fails due to undefined references to boost, it might be necessary to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/deps/finn_boost/stage/lib/boost/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### Developer documentation

If you want to contribute some changes to the C++ driver for FINN, please make sure you have the pre-commit git hook installed before you commit a pull-request.

It can be installed using the following command:

```shell
./scripts/install_precommit.sh
```

Without this precommit hook it is very likely that your code can not be merged, because it is blocked by our linter.

**Prerequisites:**

* Install XRT Runtime and development packages. You can find them here: [Download](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/alveo/u280.html)
* If you use a non default install directory for XRT (default: ```/opt/xilinx/xrt```) set the XRT env var to your XRT development package installation ```export XILINX_XRT=<path>```.

**General information for building and using the FINN C++ driver**:

The driver requires two types of configurations for operation:

* A header file which defines the type of the driver. The driver depends on which FINN-datatypes are used in the network for input and output, and can run a little faster by optimizing this at compile time. This config is either defined automatically by the FINN compiler or has to be passed to the driver by hand when compiling. The header file location can be set by using the CMAKE macro `FINN_HEADER_LOCATION`. If left undefined, the header path will be automatically defined as ```FINNCppDriver/config/FinnDriverUsedDatatypes.h``` (as included from ```./src/FINNCppDriver/FINNDriver.cpp```).

* A configuration file in the JSON format. This specifies the path to the .xclbin produced by FINN, the devices by their XRT device indices, their inputs and outputs and how they are shaped, which is needed for the folding and packing operations. Note that this is passed during the _runtime_! This means that the location of the xclbin for example does not need to be fixed.

**Using the FINN C++ driver manually:**

The FINN C++ driver can be used without FINN installing itself. As a result of that you have to do some work that is normally done by the FINN compiler.

If you want to build the driver manually on the Noctua 2 cluster, please have a look at the section: [Getting started on Noctua 2](#getting-started-on-the-n2-cluster)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eki-project/finn-cpp-driver.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
(git checkout <branch>)
./buildDependencies.sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFINNC_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=Off -DFINN_HEADER_LOCATION=%YOUR_CONFIG_HEADER_LOCATION% ..
make -j $(nprocs)
```

**Using the FINN pipeline:**

The FINN pipeline will take over most of the tasks shown above.
To use the FINN C++ driver with the FINN compiler specify `step_make_cpp_drive` as a build step and `build_cfg.DataflowOutputType.CPP_DRIVER` as an output.

The FINN pipeline will compile the FINN driver for you. (You can of course recompile the FINN C++ driver manually afterwards using the emitted source files.) If you do not want to use the C++ driver frontend, but use it as a library in your own project, please have a look at the section [external use](#external-use).

**Unittests:**

For unittest, the used configuration (meaning the runtime-JSON-config) can also be changed (because when running unittests, the JSON is actually needed at compile time). This can be done by setting

```bash
FINN_CUSTOM_UNITTEST_CONFIG
```

If left undefined, the path will be ```../../src/config/exampleConfig.json``` (as included from ```./unittests/core/UnittestConfig.h```).

### Getting Started on the N2 Cluster

You will first have to load a few dependencies before being able to build the project:

```bash
ml vis/Graphviz/2.50.0-GCCcore-11.2.0
ml fpga
ml xilinx/xrt/2.14
ml devel/Doxygen/1.9.5-GCCcore-12.2.0
ml compiler/GCC/12.2.0
ml devel/CMake/3.24.3-GCCcore-12.2.0
```

To execute the driver on the boards, write a job script. The job script should look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 0:07:00
#SBATCH -A YOUR_PROJECT
#SBATCH -p fpga
#SBATCH -o cpp-finn_out_%j.out
#SBATCH --constraint=xilinx_u280_xrt2.14

ml vis/Graphviz/2.50.0-GCCcore-11.2.0 &> /dev/null
ml fpga &> /dev/null
ml xilinx/xrt/2.14 &> /dev/null
ml lang/Python/3.10.4-GCCcore-11.3.0-bare &> /dev/null
ml compiler/GCC/12.2.0

#DO YOUR WORK WITH FINN HERE. FOR EXAMPLE CALL ./finn --help
```

Execute it with ```sbatch write.sh```.
Use ```xbutil``` to get information about the cards and configure them manually if necessary.

(Project name, resource usage, output filename, xrt version etc. are all examples and have to be set by the user themselves).

### External Use


## TODO

* Check if XRT frees the memory map itself

## Filetree

* Filenames after class names, with UpperCamelCase
* .h no template, .hpp templated
